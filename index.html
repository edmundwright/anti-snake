    <h1>Anti-Snake</h1>

    <p>The snake likes apples, which is healthy. But he's a little too keen, and will eat them before they're ripe. Slow him down by building mazes!<p>

    <ul>
      <li>Click and drag to build or destroy walls.</li>
      <li>If you hold him back for too long the apple will go rotten, and its score will go down.</li>
      <li>Take care to prevent the snake from getting trapped!</li>
    </ul>
